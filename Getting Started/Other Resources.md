## Books

There are a lot of photography books out there. I recommend heading to a used book store and checking out what photography books there are, and pick a few up on the cheap. Do that often enough and you can, like, have two shelves of your bookshelf reserved for "Photography". 

I recommend this approach - You get to read many perspectives, and every book has some nugget of insight or unique perspective that is soley its own. 

### The Print, The Camera, The Negative, Basic Techniques of Photography. - Ansel Adams
Concisely written, but pertaining exclusively to film photography. Find them at a used or independent book store on the cheap.

### Photography Q&A - Zach Arias
[Photography Q&A on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Photography-Questions-Answers-Voices-Matter/dp/0321929500)

Questions you didn't know you wanted to ask. Aimed at aspiring professionals, but full of useful information for everyone.

### Light Science and Magic: An Introduction to Photographic Lighting
[Light Science and Magic On Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Light-Science-Magic-Introduction-Photographic/dp/0415719402)
This textbook on light will make you a better photographer, even if you never shoot with light. You can't be a great photographer without a solid understanding of how light works.

### 50 Portraits - Gregory Heisler
[50 Portraits on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Gregory-Heisler-Techniques-Photographers-Photographer/dp/0823085651)

Buy the hardcover, dont buy it for ipad or kindle. 

From [Strobist](https://strobist.blogspot.com/2013/11/the-updated-essential-strobist-bookshelf.html):
> Greg Heisler's _[50 Portraits](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0823085651/giftfella-20)_ is the Gold Standard for going deep inside the thought process of a world-class portraitist. It's built around (as you might guess) fifty different portrait sessions.  

>This is very much a 360-degree book, covering planning, idea generation, thought process and, yes, lighting. The full review is [here](http://strobist.blogspot.com/2013/10/an-all-nighter-at-vista-greg-heislers.html). It's not a beginner's book. In fact, it is ideally suited for the person who is beginning to feel like maybe they already know everything that's important to know about lighting and photo. Because they don't, by a long shot.  

## Websites
### Ken Rockwell
https://www.kenrockwell.com/tech.htm

Ken Rockwell's writings and reviews are a classic resource almost every photographer has landed on at some point or another. The website has been around and updated forever, it feels like, and is fuill of great information. 

### Strobist
https://strobist.blogspot.com/

David Hobby's Strobist is **the** place to go to learn lighting. It's description of itself is accurate:

> Strobist is the world's [most popular resource](http://www.strobist.blogspot.com/2006/02/welcome-to-strobist.html) for photographers who want how to learn to use their flashes like a pro.

## Video Series/Channels
### Filmmaker IQ
https://www.youtube.com/user/FilmmakerIQcom

Filmmaker IQ is among the best at not giving yout shortcuts or easy solutions, but actually diving into the important information with detailed breakdowns.

### Pro Photographer, Cheap Camera
https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7ECB90D96DF59DE5

This old series from DigitalRev TV is well worth a watch. Stop worrying about gear! These photographers certainly had to. Puts a button on the point that knowledge of fundamentals will allow you to work with any gear.

### The Art of Photography
Nice, concise videos, with focused topics. And, unlike most of photography youtube, this channel is not just about making money from sponsored gear reviews.

### Paid Video Series
Not sure there I can recommend any of those "complete photo courses" from whichever learning service these days. Some might be fine, I don't know.

I did want to recommend Zach Arias's 'OneLight 2.0' series, but the site he created 'dedpxl.com' died a while ago. Zach Arias is around and teaching workshops, and there's at least a video of a long workshop on [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vD3qyjjPbAw). Not the high production level of his proper videos by any means, but he's still an excellent communicator.
