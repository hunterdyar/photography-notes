# Eleventy Notes

**Eleventy Notes is currently in beta. If you find any bugs or have any suggestions, please [open an issue](https://github.com/rothsandro/eleventy-notes/issues).**

Eleventy Notes is a documentation template for Eleventy, mainly designed to publish your personal notes but can be used for small documentation projects as well. For larger, more complex documentation it's better to use a real documentation tool like Docusaurus or Nextra.
