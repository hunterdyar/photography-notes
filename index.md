How To Not Drop a Camera is my collection of photography notes.

This is an opinionated photography resource, focused on the craft - not art - of photography.

This is a reference specifically for my students, and is not a holistic photography education resource. It will be, however, quite useful for anybody wanting to take their photography a step further.
