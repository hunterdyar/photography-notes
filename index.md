Eleventy Notes is a documentation template for [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/), mainly designed to publish your personal notes but can be used for small documentation projects as well. For larger, more complex documentation it's better to use a real documentation tool like [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) or [Nextra](https://nextra.site/).

This documentation is built with Eleventy Notes (of course). If you want to use this template read the [[Getting started]] guide.
